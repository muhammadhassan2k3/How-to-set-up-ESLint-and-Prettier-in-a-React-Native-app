ESLint is a widely adopted linter tool for JavaScript that helps identify and report on patterns that might indicate errors, potential bugs, or deviations from coding standards. It enforces a set of rules defined in a configuration file and provides feedback on code quality, style, and potential issues. ESLint supports extensibility through plugins and allows customization of rules to fit the specific requirements of a project or coding style.

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that automatically formats code according to a predefined set of rules. It eliminates debates about code style by enforcing a consistent formatting style across a project. Prettier supports several programming languages, including JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and more. It can be integrated into code editors and build processes to automatically format code on save or during the build pipeline.
